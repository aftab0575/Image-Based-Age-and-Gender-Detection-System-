# Image-Based Age and Gender Detection System

## Overview
The **Image-Based Age and Gender Detection System** is a powerful tool that leverages **computer vision** and **machine learning** to analyze facial features and estimate a person's **age** and **gender**. With advanced facial recognition capabilities, this system is ideal for various applications such as authentication, sentiment analysis, and user profiling.

## Key Functionalities

### 1️⃣ Face Detection
- Detects one or multiple faces in an image or video.
- Provides bounding boxes to highlight detected faces.

### 2️⃣ Facial Landmark Detection
- Identifies key facial features:
  - 👀 Eyes
  - 👃 Nose
  - 👄 Mouth
  - 🏽 Jawline
- Helps with facial alignment and expression analysis.

### 3️⃣ Face Recognition
- Matches detected faces against stored face embeddings.
- Useful for authentication and user identification systems.

### 4️⃣ Age and Gender Detection
- Predicts **age** (numerical value) and **gender** (e.g., male or female).
- Uses pre-trained models for highly accurate results.

### 5️⃣ Facial Expression Analysis
- Detects emotions such as:
  - 😀 Happy
  - 😢 Sad
  - 😡 Angry
  - 😮 Surprised
  - 😐 Neutral
- Valuable for sentiment analysis and emotion-based applications.

### 6️⃣ Face Descriptor Extraction
- Extracts high-dimensional **face embeddings** to represent unique facial features.
- Enables face similarity comparison and clustering.
